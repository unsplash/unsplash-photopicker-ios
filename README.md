## Description

UnsplashPhotoPicker is a view controller. You present it to offer your users to select one or multiple photos from Unsplash. Once they have selected photos, the view controller returns `UnsplashPhoto` objects that you can use in your app.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+
- [Unsplash API Access Key and Secret Key](https://unsplash.com/documentation#registering-your-application)

⚠️ UnsplashPhotoPicker is not compatible with Objective-C.

## Installation

### Carthage

To integrate UnsplashPhotoPicker into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "unsplash/unsplash-photopicker-ios" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `UnsplashPhotoPicker.framework` into your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods

To integrate UnsplashPhotoPicker into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'UnsplashPhotoPicker', '~> 1.0'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.

### Git submodule

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate UnsplashPhotoPicker into your project manually as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command in the project's folder:

  ```bash
  $ git submodule add https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-photopicker-ios.git
  ```

Drag the `UnsplashPhotoPicker.xcodeproj` file into your Xcode project, then drag the `UnsplashPhotoPicker.framework` to your target's "Embedded Binaries".

## Usage

❗️Before you get started, you need to register as a developer on our [Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers) portal. Once registered, create a new app to get and **Access Key** and a **Secret Key**.

### Configuration

The `UnsplashPhotoPicker` is configured with an instance of `UnsplashPhotoPickerConfiguration`:

```swift
UnsplashPhotoPickerConfiguration(accessKey: String,
                                 secretKey: String,
                                 allowsMultipleSelection: Bool,
                                 memoryCapacity: Int,
                                 diskCapacity: Int)
```
| Property                      | Type     | Optional/Required | Default |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **`accessKey`**               | _String_ | Required          | N/A     |
| **`secretKey`**               | _String_ | Required          | N/A     |
| **`allowsMultipleSelection`** | _Bool_   | Optional          | `false` |
| **`memoryCapacity`**          | _Int_    | Optional          | `50`    |
| **`diskCapacity`**            | _Int_    | Optional          | `100`   |

### Presenting

`UnsplashPhotoPicker` is a subclass of `UINavigationController`. We recommend that you present it modally or as a popover on iPad. Before presenting it, you need to implement the `UnsplashPhotoPickerDelegate` protocol, and use the `photoPickerDelegate` property to get the results.

```swift
protocol UnsplashPhotoPickerDelegate: class {
  func unsplashPhotoPicker(_ photoPicker: UnsplashPhotoPicker, didSelectPhotos photos: [UnsplashPhoto])
  func unsplashPhotoPickerDidCancel(_ photoPicker: UnsplashPhotoPicker)
}
```

### Using the results

`UnsplashPhotoPicker` returns an array of `UnsplashPhoto` objects. See [UnsplashPhoto.swift](UnsplashPhotoPicker/UnsplashPhotoPicker/Classes/Models/UnsplashPhoto.swift) for more details.
